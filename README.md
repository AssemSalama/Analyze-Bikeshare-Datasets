# Analyze-Bikeshare-Datasets
we were trying to create interactive program that shows a statistical information based on the choice of the user of which city's information to display in wich month and even in which day.
# Project Orientation
- In this project, I will use Python to explore data for three major cities in the United States, Chicago, New York City, and Washington, related to bike sharing systems.
- Through computing descriptive statistics, I will write code to import the data and respond to interesting questions about it.
- In order to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics, I will also write a script that takes in raw input.
